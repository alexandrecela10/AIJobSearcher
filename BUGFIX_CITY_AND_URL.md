# Bug Fixes - City Detection & URL Display

## 🐛 Issue 1: City Shows as "Location not specified" in Email

### Problem:
- Logs showed: `✅ City "London" found in location`
- Email showed: `📍 Location not specified`

### Root Cause:
The city was being **detected correctly** for filtering, but the `jobDetails.location` element was **empty** (Deliveroo doesn't have a location element). The city was only found in the body text.

### Solution:
```typescript
// Before: Only used element location
location: jobDetails.location || "Location not specified"

// After: Use detected city from filtering
let detectedCity = jobDetails.location;

if (criteria.cities && criteria.cities.length > 0) {
  cityMatch = criteria.cities.some((city: string) => {
    const found = locationLower.includes(city.toLowerCase());
    if (found) {
      if (!detectedCity) detectedCity = city; // ✅ Save matched city
    }
    return found;
  });
}

// Use detected city
location: detectedCity || "Location not specified"
```

### How It Works:
1. **Try to extract** location from page element
2. **If empty**, search for cities in body text
3. **When city is found**, save it as `detectedCity`
4. **Use detectedCity** in the email

### Result:
✅ Email now shows: `📍 London` (the city you searched for)

## 🐛 Issue 2: Email Shows Description Text Below URL

### Problem:
Email showed:
```
View Job →
[Long description text...]
```

User wanted just the URL link.

### Solution:
```html
<!-- Before: Button + Description -->
<p>${jobData.job.description}</p>
<a href="${url}">View Job →</a>

<!-- After: Just the URL -->
<p>🔗 <a href="${url}">${url}</a></p>
```

### Result:
✅ Email now shows clean URL:
```
🔗 https://careers.deliveroo.com/jobs/12345
```

## 📊 Improvements Made

### 1. Better Location Detection
Added multiple selectors to find location:
```typescript
const locationEl = document.querySelector('[class*="location"]');
const locationEl2 = document.querySelector('[data-qa*="location"]');
const locationEl3 = document.querySelector('[aria-label*="location"]');
```

### 2. Fallback to Matched City
If no location element found, use the city that was matched during filtering.

### 3. Added Logging
```typescript
console.log(`Location extracted: "${jobDetails.location}"`);
```
Now you can see in logs what location was extracted from the page.

### 4. Simplified Email
- Removed description text
- Removed "View Job →" button
- Just shows clean URL link

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case: Deliveroo Jobs

**Before:**
```
📍 Location not specified
[Description text...]
View Job →
```

**After:**
```
📍 London
🔗 https://careers.deliveroo.com/jobs/12345
```

## 🎓 What You Learned

### Software Engineering Principle:
**"Data flows through multiple stages - track it!"**

The city data went through:
1. **Extraction** - Try to get from page element
2. **Filtering** - Check if it matches user's cities
3. **Storage** - Save to job result
4. **Display** - Show in email

**The bug:** We extracted and filtered correctly, but didn't save the filtered result!

**The fix:** Save the matched city during filtering, use it for display.
