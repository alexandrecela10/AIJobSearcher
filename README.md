# ü§ñ AI Job Searcher

## Context: 
This is me speaking. Gemini will speak in below sections. I am tinkering with vibe coding for fun and also to improve and develop good propotype software engineering skils. My aim is, whenever I have an idea for a new solution solving a client's problem, I can test it out in the market fast, and get out of 'in theory' land. To deploy demonstrated value, and fast

This software is also going to the first out of a 'AI for my girlfriend' series where I build AI that makes my princess life easier, and will maybe make her realise that Data and AI are not that boring

## Value Proposition
> **Automate your job search:** AI-powered tool that finds matching jobs across multiple companies, analyzes your CV, extracts job requirements, and customizes your application‚Äîall while you sleep.

**Pain Points Solved:**
- ‚ùå Manually searching dozens of company career pages
- ‚ùå Applying with generic CVs that don't match job requirements
- ‚ùå Missing jobs because you don't know seniority level or visa requirements
- ‚ùå Spending hours customizing CVs for each application

**Built with:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, OpenAI GPT-4, Playwright, PostgreSQL

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works: Step-by-Step Implementation

### **Step 1: User Submits Search Criteria**
```typescript
// app/api/submit/route.ts
1. User fills form (companies, roles, cities, CV)
2. Validate input and file upload (max 2MB)
3. Generate unique submission ID
4. Save to PostgreSQL database
5. Save CV file to uploads/
6. Trigger auto-process or return manual steps
```

### **Step 2: Expand Companies with AI**
```typescript
// app/api/process-jobs/route.ts - expandCompanies()
1. Take user's company list (e.g., "Stripe, Google")
2. Ask OpenAI to suggest 8 similar companies
3. Return expanded list (10 companies total)
   Example: "Stripe" ‚Üí adds "Revolut, Wise, Monzo..."
```

### **Step 3: Find Careers URLs**
```typescript
// app/api/process-jobs/route.ts - findCareersUrls()
1. For each company, ask OpenAI for careers page URL
2. OpenAI returns: {"url": "https://...", "confidence": "high"}
3. Build list of companies + their careers URLs
```

### **Step 4: Scrape Jobs with Playwright**
```typescript
// app/api/process-jobs/route.ts - scrapeJobsAndCustomizeCVs()
For each company (limit 5 for speed):
  1. Launch headless browser
  2. Visit careers URL
  3. Try to find search box ‚Üí fill with role name
  4. Extract job links from page (filter out blogs, news, etc.)
  5. If no job links found ‚Üí skip company immediately
  6. For each job link (limit 3 per company):
     a. Visit job page
     b. Extract: title, location, description
     c. Check if role matches (title or body text)
     d. Check if city matches (location or body text)
     e. If both match ‚Üí proceed to CV analysis
```

### **Step 5: AI-Powered CV Analysis**
```typescript
// app/api/process-jobs/route.ts - customizeCv()
1. Send to OpenAI GPT-4:
   - Job title and description
   - Your CV content
   
2. AI returns structured JSON:
   {
     "cvIssues": ["Missing metrics", "No cloud experience"],
     "recommendations": ["Add quantifiable results", "Highlight AWS"],
     "seniorityInfo": "Senior (5-7 years experience)",
     "visaInfo": "Visa sponsorship available",
     "customizedCv": "Improved CV text...",
     "changes": ["Added data pipeline metrics", "Emphasized AWS"]
   }
```

### **Step 6: Send Email with Results**
```typescript
// app/api/send-email/route.ts
1. Group jobs by company
2. Generate HTML email with:
   - Job title, location, URL
   - üìä Job Requirements (seniority, visa)
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è CV Issues
   - üí° Recommendations
   - ‚ú® Customized CV
3. Send via Nodemailer (SMTP)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Challenges

### **1. Location Detection Accuracy**
- **Issue:** Some job pages don't have structured location elements
- **Current Solution:** Fallback to searching body text for city names
- **Improvement Needed:** Better location extraction using multiple selectors and AI parsing

### **2. Career Page Variations**
- **Issue:** Each company has different career page structures (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, custom)
- **Current Solution:** Generic link extraction with filters
- **Improvement Needed:** Template system for popular ATS platforms

### **3. Rate Limiting & Timeouts**
- **Issue:** Some career pages are slow or have anti-bot protection
- **Current Solution:** 60-second timeout per company, skip if no jobs found
- **Improvement Needed:** Retry logic, proxy rotation, better timeout handling

### **4. CV Analysis Quality**
- **Issue:** AI sometimes gives generic recommendations
- **Current Solution:** Structured prompts with examples
- **Improvement Needed:** Fine-tuned model on job descriptions + CV pairs

### **5. Scalability**
- **Issue:** Processing 10 companies takes 3-5 minutes
- **Current Solution:** Limit to 5 companies, 3 jobs per company
- **Improvement Needed:** Queue system (Bull/Redis), parallel processing, caching
