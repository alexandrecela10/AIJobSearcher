# 📧 Step 5: Send Results via Email

## Overview

Step 5 allows users to email their job search results, including all matched jobs and customized CVs, to their email address.

---

## Features

### 1. **Email Summary**
- Shows total companies matched
- Shows total jobs found
- Shows total customized CVs generated
- Displays search criteria used

### 2. **Email Content**
The email includes:

  - Company name and careers page URL
  - Job title, location, description, and direct link
  - **Full customized CV** for that specific role

### 3. **Development vs Production**

#### Development Mode (Current):
- Emails are **logged to the terminal console**
- No actual email is sent
- You can see the full email content in the terminal

#### Production Mode (Future):

- Sends real emails via services like:
  - Gmail SMTP
  - SendGrid
  - AWS SES
  - Mailgun

## How It Works

### User Flow:

```
Step 4: Review Results
  ↓
Click "Continue to Step 5"
  ↓
Step 5: Email page loads
  ↓
User reviews email preview
  ↓
User clicks "Send Email"
  ↓
API sends email (or logs in dev mode)
  ↓
Success message shown
```

### Technical Flow:

```typescript
// 1. Step 5 page loads
useEffect(() => {
  // Load job results from localStorage
  const results = localStorage.getItem("jobResults");
  
  // Load user email from submission
  const submission = localStorage.getItem("selectedSubmission");
  const email = submission.email;
});

// 2. User clicks "Send Email"
async function sendEmail() {
  // Call API with email, criteria, and results
  await fetch("/api/send-email", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, criteria, results })
  });
}

// 3. API generates email
function generateEmailHtml() {
  // Create beautiful HTML email with:
  // - Summary section
  // - Job listings
  // - Customized CVs
  // - Styling
}

// 4. API sends email (or logs in dev)
if (isDevelopment) {
  console.log(emailContent); // Log to terminal
} else {
  await transporter.sendMail(...); // Send real email
}
```

## Configuration

### For Development (Current Setup):

No configuration needed! Emails are logged to console.

### For Production (Future):

Create a `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# Or use SendGrid
SMTP_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey
SMTP_PASS=your-sendgrid-api-key
```

---

## Testing

### Test in Development:

1. Complete Steps 1-4 to get job results
2. Go to Step 5
3. Click "Send Email"
4. Check your **terminal console** for the email preview
5. You'll see the full email content logged

### Example Terminal Output:

```
📧 ===== EMAIL PREVIEW =====
To: your.email@example.com
Subject: Your Job Search Results - 5 Matches Found

--- EMAIL CONTENT ---
🎯 YOUR JOB SEARCH RESULTS
=========================
[Full email content here]
===== END EMAIL =====
```

## File Structure

```
app/
├── step5/
│   └── page.tsx              # Step 5 UI
└── api/
    └── send-email/
        └── route.ts          # Email sending API
```

---

## Key Components

### 1. Step 5 Page (`app/step5/page.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Display email preview and send button

**Features**:
- Loads job results from localStorage
- Shows summary statistics
- Displays search criteria
- Previews email content
- Sends email on button click

### 2. Email API (`app/api/send-email/route.ts`)

**Purpose**: Generate and send emails

**Features**:
- Validates input data
- Generates HTML email
- Generates plain text email
- Logs in development mode
- Sends via SMTP in production

---

## Email Generation Functions

### `generateEmailHtml()`

Creates a beautiful HTML email with:
- Inline CSS styling
- Responsive design
- Professional layout
- Clickable links
- Formatted CVs

### `generateEmailText()`

Creates a plain text version with:
- ASCII art headers
- Clear sections
- All the same content as HTML
- Fallback for email clients that don't support HTML

---

## Security Considerations

### Email Validation:
```typescript
// Email is validated in Step 1 form
<input type="email" required />
```

### SMTP Credentials:
```typescript
// Never commit SMTP credentials to git
// Use environment variables
const user = process.env.SMTP_USER;
const pass = process.env.SMTP_PASS;
```

### Rate Limiting (Future):
```typescript
// Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
// Limit to 10 emails per hour per user
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Email Templates**
- Allow users to choose email templates
- Customize email styling
- Add company logo

### 2. **Attachments**
- Attach customized CVs as PDF files
- Include cover letters

### 3. **Scheduling**
- Schedule email to be sent later
- Set up recurring job search emails

### 4. **Multiple Recipients**
- Send to multiple email addresses
- CC/BCC support

### 5. **Email Tracking**
- Track when email is opened
- Track link clicks
- Analytics dashboard

---

## Troubleshooting

### Email not appearing in development?

**Check the terminal console** - emails are logged there, not sent to your inbox.

### Want to test with real emails?

Set up SMTP credentials in `.env.local` and change:
```typescript
const isDevelopment = false; // Force production mode
```

### Gmail SMTP not working?

1. Enable 2-factor authentication
2. Generate an "App Password"
3. Use the app password instead of your regular password

---
